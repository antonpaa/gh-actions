## GitHub Actions Demonstration

A simple demonstration/proof-of-concept with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions). The repository is based on the GitHub Training's course [GitHub Actions: Hello World](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-actions:-hello-world).

- GH Actions can be viewed at the project page's [Actions](https://github.com/antonpaa/gh-actions/actions)-tab.
- The initial setup can be seen at closed [PRs](https://github.com/antonpaa/gh-actions/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) and [Issues](https://github.com/antonpaa/gh-actions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).
